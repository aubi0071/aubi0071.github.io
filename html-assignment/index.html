                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi, I’m Zak! If I had to give you the CliffsNotes&reg; version of who I am, I’d say that I’m mostly an <em>extrovert</em>; I <em>love music</em> and play any instrument I can get my hands on; I have lots of <em>tattoos</em> and would have my hands tattooed if my mom wasn’t so against the idea; and this is about my 10<sup>th</sup> year doing some fort of graphic design.</p> 
                <p>I feel silly to say it but this pandemic has been pretty good for me—other than being in isolation for almost a year, I’ve been able to use the time to figure out what’s really important to me and I’ve even started acting on some of my findings: I’m now in school for design, and I’m about 90% done my first <abbr title="&quot;Extended Play&quot; or mini record; only 5 songs">EP</abbr> (which I’m writing and recording on my own).</p>
