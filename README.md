ALRIGHT so... first off, hey Rob! I'll miss you once this is submitted.

This site was way harder to make than I thought... I designed it all on a grid system and was very careful to not make it any more complicated than I thought I could handle. Turns out, I can't handle a lot!

The BIGGEST challenge I faced was on the Design page: I wanted to have each thumbnail open an overlay when clicked which would show more information on each project. I did this with JavaScript and it seemed fine... until this morning (Aug 13... Friday the 13th... omg maybe that's what happened!!) when I realized I was toggling an ID of "overlay" to make the pictures open up... on 5 different pictures... all with the same ID... yeah no that didn't work. So, I scrapped it entirely and made separate pages for each project, and while that works, it's not exactly elegant.

The same issue was in the camerawork tab, where I wanted a zoomed image to pop up when you clicked on the thumbnails. Defeated by the Design page, I just decided to forego that whole idea but I'd still like to figure it out for when this portfolio actually goes live.

Something COOL that I learned through making my first multi-page site was to make classes like Bootstrap so I can quickly style things MY way but not have to leave HTML. I made a bunch of classes like this, but the most helpful was pg-end-sm/md/lg; that way I could make sure each page had the same space between the last element and the footer (and also allows the page to scroll behind the footer if the screen size is too wide). 

Finally, my big takeaway is this: I like coding... for the first day. Then the days turn to weeks and my shoulders start hurting and then I can't sleep......... I am so down to look at someone's code and problem-solve, but GOLLY I do not like cleaning up my own messes.

Things I borrowed:
- Mobile Nav from https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_mobile_navbar.asp
- ...wow, I thought for sure there would be more than that but I don't think so.

Alright, that's it for my rambling. Have a great fall, Rob :)
